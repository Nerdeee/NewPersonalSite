    <div class="indexContent">
        <p class="p1">Hi, my name is George Larres. I am a Computer Science graduate from California State University,
            Fresno and a
            professional software engineer with experience in web development, machine learning and AI, and have
            recently begun a mobile app project that uses a machine learning model that I developed. I enjoy learning
            about programming, computers, and mathematics and exploring the intricacies and intersections of these
            domains. Outside of this skillset, I enjoy listening to and playing music, specifically, the guitar as well
            as watching movies and playing video games. I've also been exploring more visual arts that I used to do as a
            kid such as clay sculpting.
